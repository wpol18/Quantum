# Quantum
This code repository serves to hold some code that explores quantum programming. As of now, there is only an education section
where I will continue to upload Jupyter Notebooks of varying complexity using different quantum software frameworks

## Motivation
Quantum computing has progressed a lot since I first got involved in 2017. There are some excellent software frameworks with fantastic
documentation, and yet, it seems to me that not too many people know about quantum computing yet (and that you can access––right this
moment––QPUs online!) I hope that as I continue to add to this repository, both projects and educational tutorials, more folks can 
get involved and learn about this exciting, new technology

## Frameworks
I suspect most, if not all, of this will be in Python, as most of the major quantum software frameworks like Rigetti's pyQuil,
IBM's QISKit, ETH Zurich's ProjectQ, Xanadu's Blackbird, and Google's Cirq are in Python (notable exception being Microsoft's
new C#-inspired Q#)

## Lots to come!
