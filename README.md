# Quantum Repository

This repository exists to house various projects involving quantum computation and quantum information processing. As of now, the only project in this repository will deal with education surrounding some of the popular quantum software frameworks in Python, and quantum computing/quantum programming more generally.

Installation of Python and the various software framworks used will not be covered
