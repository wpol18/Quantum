    "_ProjectQ_ is an open-source software framework for quantum computing started at ETH Zurich. One can write programs in a \"quantum circuit\" style syntax, much like the instruction sets QASM and Quil underlying IBM Q's QISKit and Rigetti Forest's pyQuil. Users' programs can be compiled onto a variety of backends, like a local simulator, ProjectQ's quantum emulator, or an actual IBM QPU. For more info on ProjectQ, check out [their official website](https://projectq.ch/) and head to their [Code & Docs](https://projectq.ch/code-and-docs/) page for further links to their documentation, installation guide, and other tutorials."

    "The fundamental units of quantum computation are _qubits_, quantum bits. One often hears about a qubit being in two states simultaneously, a phenomenon we call __superposition__: \"A bit can be a $0$ _or_ a $1$, but a qubit can be __both__ at the same time!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This description is a _very_ rough analogy, and fairly imprecise. In some sense it tries to capture an aspect of what superposition refers to: the principle that the addition of two quantum states yields another, equally valid quantum state (or for those with some background in linear algebra: superposition is a complex linear addition of two basis states). But it fails to capture another important aspect of superposition: when we actually \"measure\" our qubit, that is, read out its value at the end of some series of operations, we no longer have this \"$0$ and $1$ at the same time\"-ness property; the superposition collapses to either a $0$ _or_ a $1$. Which it collapses to depends probabilistically on the specific mathematical description of the superposition state of the qubit (for a great article on the _meaning_ behind a quantum state, check out [this piece](http://cognitivemedium.com/qm-interpretation) by Michael Nielsen).\n",

    "To make this more concrete, lets take a look at how the state of a qubit can be represented using [_Dirac_ notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation), a useful short-hand notation one can use to do linear algebra made by physicist Paul Dirac to succinctly describe quantum states. We can represent the state of any qubit with the following generalized form:\n",

When a superposition state is measured, the state will collapse to either a $|0\\rangle$ or a $|1\\rangle$; $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex values associated with the probaility of observing a collapse to either $0$ or $1$ (respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there is a direct relationship between these amplitudes and the probability of observing either state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Pr(0), \\Pr(1) = |\\alpha|^2, |\\beta|^2 $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1 $$\n",
